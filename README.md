# What is this?

These are CSV files suitable for copying / pasting into [CHIRP](https://chirpmyradio.com)
to configure amateur radio HTs.

The repeaters are local to NYC and intended for use in helping new hams get on the air.

Thanks to [N2YCR](https://wiki.nycresistor.com/wiki/Ham_Radio) for the idea.

# How do I use this?

1. [Get a ham license](https://wiki.nycresistor.com/wiki/Ham_Radio#Getting_licensed)
2. Get a HT, like a Baofeng UV-5R or similar
3. Download [CHIRP](https://chirpmyradio.com)
4. Find the repeaters of interest to you in these CSV files and copy/paste into Chirp
